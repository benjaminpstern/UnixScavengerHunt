Here we find two squirrels, they don't make much sense
You'll have to use some UNIX tools to find out their two cents

The first squirrel speaks some, but they're not the english type
to find out what he's saying you'll have to use the decoder with a ____

The second squirrel speaks too but it's always out of order
you'll need two UNIX tools to figure him out, doing it by hand would be torture

Also with the second squirrel, he speaks a lot, but lacks the mind
To mention that out of what he says, you only will need four lines

Be careful with the decoder, you'll need to use it right
If you get stuck, remember that Ctrl+C will help you fight

END OF BAD POEM

These squirrels and the decoder are C programs, so be sure to use ./ in front of
the file names to run them.
