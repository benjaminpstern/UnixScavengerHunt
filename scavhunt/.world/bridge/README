A bridge. Behind you are grasslands, while ahead is a forest.
Inscribed on the bridge is a quote:

"When you go to the dentist, you want your teeth to hurt!
... I mean, you want the novocaine, but you want to know that without it, it would REALLY HURT.
I think being a teacher is like being a dentist.
You inflict pain--but it's good pain!"
