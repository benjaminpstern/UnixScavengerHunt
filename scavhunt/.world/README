Welcome to the scavenger hunt world!

It's a large world out there with mountains, forests, and oceans.

You currently find yourself near a stream, with a bridge over the stream leading to a forest.
Further down the stream there are grasslands with mountains faintly visible in the distance.
Navigate the world with cd.
If there are any interesting files, make sure to use cat, less, or your preferred text editor to view them.

Your first task is to find a clue.
If you know anything about clues, they're generally hidden underneath rocks.
There might be some rocks by the stream...

Useful commands: grep
