Welcome to the OCCS Unix Scavenger Hunt!

This is a challenge designed to get you acquainted with the powerful tools Unix offers.

To find information on any Unix command, type

man <command>

So if I wanted information on the unix command "ls", I would type

man ls

Useful commands for this scavenger hunt:
ls - list the contents of a directory
echo - print a string
cd - change the current working directory
cat - print the contents of a file
less - view the contents of a file
text editors nano, vim, and emacs - editors designed specifically for efficiently writing code
find - find a file in the directory structure
grep - a tool for searching for text and patterns in files and directories
sed - a tool for searching and replacing patterns in files

Good Luck!
